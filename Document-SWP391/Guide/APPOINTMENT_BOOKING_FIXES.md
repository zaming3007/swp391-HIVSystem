# Appointment Booking System - Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch
**Problem**: The `Appointment` model didn't match the database schema, causing "An error occurred while saving the entity changes" error.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing `FacilityID` field in the model
- Missing several fields like `EndTime`, `AppointmentType`, `Purpose`, `ReminderSent`, `CreatedBy`
- Status field had wrong default value

**Solution**:
- Updated `Appointment.cs` model to match database schema
- Created `Facility.cs` model
- Updated `ApplicationDbContext.cs` with proper entity configurations
- Created `DatabaseController.cs` for schema initialization

### 2. Profile System Issues
**Problem**: 
- Account views were incomplete and not user-friendly
- Profile page didn't show appointment history
- Navigation to profile was broken

**Solution**:
- Removed old Account views
- Enhanced `Profile.js` component with:
  - Tabbed interface (Personal Info + Appointment History)
  - Real-time appointment loading
  - Modern UI with proper status badges
  - Comprehensive appointment details display

### 3. Appointment History Loading Error
**Problem**: "Lỗi tải dữ liệu" when accessing appointment history

**Root Cause**: 
- Database query using JOIN instead of Include
- Missing facility information in queries

**Solution**:
- Updated `GetMyAppointments` API method to use proper Entity Framework Include
- Added facility information to appointment responses
- Improved error handling and user feedback
